## General Information

Problem Statement is to come up with a prediction of demand for shared bikes.A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.

In such an attempt, Boom Bikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after the ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits Business Goal:

We will be using multi-linear regression model to come with prediction to the above business case. End output of the model is to identify key features contributing significantly towards explaining the demand of the shared bikes. So that this can be imbibed by the Boom bikes to enhance their business.

For this use case we are using day data for all bike rentals for the year 2018 and 2019 and a data dictionary.

Steps involved in Multiple Linear Regression

Step 1: Read the data from the source
Step 2: Understand The data
Step 3: Clean up the data, drop unwanted columns, check for duplicates etc
Step 4: EDA
Step 5: Map all categorical variables to Dummy variables
Step 6: Train and test split
Step 7: Scaling
Step 8: Feature Selection
Step 9: Evaluate Test set


## Conclusions
The top 3 features contributing significantly towards explaining the demand of the shared bikes
1) Feeling temperature
2) Light Snow
3) Year
